# Private JSON Test

This is a demo of using the private JSON framework included in the iPhone OS to parse and write JSON.

Read more about this discovery in [my blog post](http://samsoff.es/post/parsing-json-with-the-iphones-private-json-framework).

### Notes

This is intended to run on iPhone OS 3.1. It has also been tested on the device and the simulator.

Obviously this could break at anytime since it's all undocumented.
